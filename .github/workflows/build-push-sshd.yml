# Panubo build and push to Quay.io and ECR Public
# This GH Action is intended for public docker images that package upstream applications/services (ie not for projects of Panubo's).
# For repos that build multiple repos use the multi-build-push.yml workflow.
#
# This workflow runs on pushes to "main", PRs (does not push) or matching git tags.
# Image names are generated from the repository name, if "docker-" is part of the repository name it is removed from the docker image name.
#
# Additionally this workflow performs some automated testing after a docker build.
# Automated testing is triggered by `make _ci_test`, if no test is required the Makefile target should just run `true`.
# Before tests are run a Docker build is performed, the resulting image has a tag of "test"
# BATS is installed since it is commonly required by the tests.
